### Revised Example Paragraph
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of computational systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. By enabling machines to perceive their environment and make informed decisions, AI mimics human cognitive functions, allowing for advancements in various fields. For instance, AI algorithms power search engines like Google, which not only optimize information retrieval but also personalize user experiences based on individual search histories. This integration of AI into everyday technology illustrates its profound influence on how we access and interact with information.
